 # Block Templating

 > Tired of having to type to make blocks of text to decorate and organise your dotfiles ?

 ```bash=
 " ===========[ Fear not more ! ]===========
 ```

## A shit solution to a non-problem !

This beautiful vim plugin has so much to offer !

### Can do's
* Converts a template to a block of text !
> ie 
```vim
46
__prep__^__comchar__^ ^
__surround__^[ ^ ]
=`l^__txt__^=`r
```
Get's tranlated to 
```vim
" ==============[ Such wows ]==============
```
Once fed to this state of the art script
* Want more blocks, just add more template... **stonks**
* Your title is too long don't worry, the script does some kinda intellegent wrapping of the lines (much to be improved)

### Can't do's
* It's...um how to say. Not good (first vim plugin)
* Barelly holds together with duct tape and try cheetos
* Probably has already been done better
* It doesden't do not make coffe...


Cya you animal
